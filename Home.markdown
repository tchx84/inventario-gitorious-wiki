# About

Inventario is a complete system for managing logistics of OLPC XO laptop deployments. It is used heavily in OLPC projects executed by [ParaguayEduca](http://www.paraguayeduca.org/) (10,000+ laptops in over 40 schools in Paraguay) and [Fundaci√≥n Zamora Teran](http://www.fundacionzt.org/) (20,000+ laptops in over 80 schools in Nicaragua).

Inventario was orignally developed within ParaguayEduca, and the ParaguayEduca wiki continues to document installation instructions for their version of inventario, for which development was stopped for a long time. During that time, the project was adopted by the main OLPC project in Nicaragua and improvements were made in collaboration with Martin Abente, one of the original inventario architects from Paraguay. In the present day, the version of inventario found here is used by Nicaragua; the OLPC Paraguay project remains with an older version (documented on the ParaguayEduca wiki) but is expected to migrate to this version as time permits.
